## My process

This one is missing the email validation error that is supposed to be there.  The challenge didn't list JavaScript as a part of the solution, so I tried to do it with HTML and CSS only, but I never could get it.  I'll post an update as soon as I figure it out, or I'll add the JavaScript and just call it done.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
